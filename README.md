# Employee Churn Prediction for Salifort Motors

## Overview
This project aims to provide data-driven insights and recommendations for the HR department at Salifort Motors to improve employee satisfaction levels and reduce turnover. By analyzing the collected employee data, we aim to build a predictive model that can identify factors contributing to employee churn, thereby enabling proactive measures to retain valuable talent.

## PACE Workflow
### Plan (P)
- **Business Scenario and Problem**: The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to understand what factors contribute to employee turnover. They aim to predict which employees are likely to leave the company.
- **Goals**: Analyze employee data and build a predictive model to identify employees at risk of leaving, thus enabling proactive retention strategies.

### Analyze (A)
#### Step 1: Data Exploration
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and distribution.
- Clean the data by addressing missing values, duplicates, outliers, and data type conversions.

#### Step 2: Data Visualizations
- Visualize relationships between variables to gain insights into factors influencing employee churn.

### Construct (C)
#### Step 3: Model Building
- Identify the prediction task: Classification (predicting employee churn based on various features).
- Choose appropriate models: Random Forest Classifier.
- Encode categorical data for modeling.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Train the model and evaluate its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
- Visualize feature importance to identify key predictors of employee churn.

### Execute (E)
#### Step 4: Results and Evaluation
- Summarize model results and performance metrics.
- Provide conclusions and actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
### Conclusion
- The Random Forest Classifier yielded impressive results in predicting employee churn.
- Key influencers of employee churn include satisfaction level, number of projects, tenure, average monthly hours, and last evaluation.

### Recommendations
1. Conduct regular surveys or interviews to measure and improve employee satisfaction levels.
2. Assign projects based on employee skills, interests, and workload to prevent stress and boredom.
3. Recognize and reward employees with long tenure to show appreciation for their loyalty.
4. Provide development opportunities for employees with short tenure to foster growth and engagement.
5. Monitor and regulate average monthly hours to maintain a healthy work-life balance.
6. Evaluate employees fairly and objectively to boost morale and motivation.

By implementing these recommendations, Salifort Motors can enhance employee satisfaction, reduce turnover, and foster a positive work environment.
